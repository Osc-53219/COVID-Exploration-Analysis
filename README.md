# COVID Exploration Analysis

Welcome to the COVID Exploration Analysis project! In this repository, I've delved into COVID-19 data to gain insights, visualize trends, and answer crucial questions about the pandemic's impact on different regions and populations.

## Tableau Dashboard

I've created an interactive Tableau dashboard to complement my analysis. Explore the visualizations and dive deeper into the data for a comprehensive understanding of COVID-19's global impact.

## Data Analysis

### Total Cases vs. Total Deaths

I've calculated the likelihood of death if one contracts COVID-19 in their country. Check out the analysis in the SQL code for details.

### Total Cases vs. Population

Discover what percentage of the population in various regions contracted COVID-19 over time. SQL queries reveal these insights.

### Highest Infection Rate

Explore countries with the highest infection rates compared to their populations. My analysis helps identify regions that were most affected.

### Countries with the Highest Death Count

Find out which countries witnessed the highest COVID-19 death counts relative to their populations.

### Breakdown by Continent

Analyze COVID-19's impact on continents, including total death counts and other key statistics.

### Global Numbers

Get a grasp of the global COVID-19 statistics, including total cases, total deaths, and the overall death percentage.

### Vaccination Data

I've merged COVID-19 death data with vaccination data to provide insights into vaccination progress.

### Visualization and Further Analysis

I've used SQL, Tableau, and other tools to create compelling visualizations and in-depth analysis. Feel free to explore the SQL code and Tableau dashboard to understand the pandemic's dynamics better.
